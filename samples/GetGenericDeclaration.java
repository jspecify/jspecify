// (that is, with addComputedTypeAnnotations commented out): reproduced the error at
// getGenericDeclaration but also had the undesired error at TypeVariable<?>, which somehow doesn't
// come up when analyzing Guava, perhaps related to the specific order in which the compiler visits
// elements and types...?
//
// and the errors in this file persist even with my addComputedTypeAnnotations override restored...
