# Nullness Specification

<div style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>version 1.0.0</div>

This document specifies the semantics of the JSpecify nullness annotations.

> This document is mainly useful to authors of analysis tools. Some very
> advanced users might find it interesting, but it would make a very poor
> introduction for anyone else; instead see our **[Start Here](/docs/start-here)
> page**.

## Normative and non-normative sections

This document contains some non-normative comments to emphasize points or to
anticipate likely questions. Those comments are set off as block quotes.

> This is an example of a non-normative comment.

This document also links to other documents. Those documents are non-normative,
except for when we link to the Java Language Specification to defer to its
rules.

> ### The word "nullable"
>
> In this doc, we try not to refer to whether a type "is nullable." Instead, we
> define four kinds of "Is it nullable?" questions we can ask for any given type
> usage:
>
> 1.  What is the [augmented type] of that type usage?
> 2.  Do I have to handle the case where `null` comes out of it?
> 3.  Do I have to prevent `null` from going into it?
> 4.  Is this type a subtype of that type with respect to nullness?
>
> ### The scope of this spec
>
> This spec does not address *when* tools must apply any part of the spec. For
> example, it does not state when tools must check that the [subtyping] relation
> holds.
>
> We anticipate that tools will typically apply each part of this spec in the
> same cases that they (or `javac`) already apply the corresponding part of the
> Java Language Specification. For example, if code contains the parameterized
> type `List<@Nullable Foo>`, we anticipate that tools will check that
> `@Nullable Foo` is a subtype of the bound of the type parameter of `List`.
>
> However, this is up to tool authors, who may have reasons to take a different
> approach. For example:
>
> -   Java [places some restrictions that are not necessary for soundness][#49],
>     and it
>     [is lenient in at least one way that can lead to runtime errors][#65].
>
> -   JSpecify annotations can be used even by tools that are not "nullness
>     checkers" at all. For example, a tool that lists the members of an API
>     could show the nullness of each type in the API, without any checking that
>     those types are "correct."
>
> -   Even when a tool is a "nullness checker," it might be written for another
>     language, like Kotlin, with its own rules for when to perform type checks.
>     Or the tool might target a future version of Java whose language features
>     would not be covered by this version of this spec.
>
> Note also that this spec covers only nullness information *from JSpecify
> annotations*. Tools may have additional sources of information. For example, a
> tool may recognize additional annotations, or a tool may omit the concept of
> `UNSPECIFIED` and apply a policy that type usages like `Object` are always
> non-nullable.

## Relationship between this spec and the JLS {#concept-references}

When a rule in this spec refers to any concept that is defined in this spec (for
example, [substitution] or [containment]), apply this spec's definition (as
opposed to other definitions, such as the ones in the Java Language
Specification (JLS)).

Additionally, when a rule in this spec refers to a JLS rule that in turn refers
to a concept that is defined in this spec, likewise apply this spec's
definition.

In particular, when a JLS rule refers to types, apply this spec's definition of
[augmented types] \(as opposed to [base types]).

This specification covers all JLS constructs up to [Java SE 23].

## Base type

A *base type* is a type as defined in [JLS 4].

> JLS 4 does not consider a type-use annotation to be a part of the type it
> annotates, so neither does our concept of "base type."

We use *class* for classes, interfaces, enums, annotations, and records.

## Type components

A *type component* of a given type is a type that transitively forms some part
of that type. Specifically, a type component is one of the following:

-   a non-wildcard type argument
-   a wildcard bound
-   an array component type
-   an enclosing type
-   an element of an intersection type
-   the entire type

## Nullness operator

A *nullness operator* specifies nullness information in an [augmented type].
JSpecify defines four nullness operators:

-   `UNION_NULL`
-   `NO_CHANGE`
-   `UNSPECIFIED`
-   `MINUS_NULL`

> The informal meaning of the operators is:
>
> -   `UNION_NULL`: This is the operator produced by putting `@Nullable` on a
>     type usage.
>     -   The type usage `String UNION_NULL` includes `"a"`, `"b"`, `"ab"`,
>         etc., plus `null`.
>     -   The type-variable usage `T UNION_NULL` includes all members of the
>         type argument substituted in for `T`, plus `null` if it was not
>         already included.
> -   `MINUS_NULL`: This is the operator produced by putting `@NonNull` on a
>     type usage.
>     -   The type usage `String MINUS_NULL` includes `"a"`, `"b"`, `"ab"`,
>         etc., without including `null`.
>     -   The type-variable usage `T MINUS_NULL` includes all members of the
>         type argument substituted in for `T` except that it does not include
>         `null` even when the type argument does.
> -   `NO_CHANGE`: This operator is important on type-variable usages, where it
>     means that the nullness of the type comes from the type argument.
>     -   The type usage `String NO_CHANGE` includes `"a"`, `"b"`, `"ab"`, etc.,
>         without including `null`. (This is equivalent to `String MINUS_NULL`.)
>     -   The type-variable usage `T NO_CHANGE` includes exactly the members of
>         the type argument substituted in for `T`: If `null` was a member of
>         the type argument, then it is a member of `T NO_CHANGE`. If it was not
>         a member of the type argument, then it is not a member of `T
>         NO_CHANGE`.
> -   `UNSPECIFIED`: This is the operator produced by "completely unannotated
>     code"â€”outside a [null-marked scope] and with no annotation on the type.
>     -   The type usage `String UNSPECIFIED` includes `"a"`, `"b"`, `"ab"`,
>         etc., but whether `null` should be included is not specified.
>     -   The type-variable usage `T UNSPECIFIED` includes all members of `T`,
>         except that there is no specification of whether `null` should be
>         added to the set (if it is not already a member), removed (if it is
>         already a member), or included only when the substituted type argument
>         includes it.

## Augmented type

An augmented type consists of a [base type] and a [nullness operator]
corresponding to *each* of its [type components].

> Arguably, an augmented type with nullness operator `UNSPECIFIED` is better
> understood not as representing "a type" but as representing a *lack* of the
> nullness portion of the type.

For our purposes, base types (and thus augmented types) include not just class
types, array types, and type variables but also [intersection types] and the
null type.

> This spec aims to define rules for augmented types compatible with those that
> the JLS defines for base types.
>
> Accordingly, in almost all cases, this spec agrees with the JLS's rules when
> specifying what *base* types appear in a piece of code. It makes an exception
> for ["Bound of an unbounded wildcard,"](#unbounded-wildcard) for which it
> specifies a bound of `Object` that the JLS does not specify.

When this spec uses single capital letters in `code font`, they refer to
augmented types (unless otherwise noted). This is in contrast to the JLS, which
typically uses them to refer to base types.

When this spec refers to "the nullness operator of" a type `T`, it refers
specifically to the nullness operator of the type component that is the entire
type `T`, without reference to the nullness operator of any other type that is a
component of `T` or has `T` as a component. The entire type is also called the
"root" type.

> For example, "the nullness operator of `List<Object>`" refers to whether the
> list itself may be `null`, not whether its elements may be.

## Details common to all annotations

For all named annotations referred to by this spec:

-   The Java package name is `org.jspecify.annotations`.
-   The Java module name is `org.jspecify`.
-   The Maven artifact is `org.jspecify:jspecify`.

All annotations have runtime retention. None of the annotations are marked
[repeatable].

## The type-use annotations

We provide two parameterless type-use annotations: `@Nullable` and `@NonNull`.

### Recognized locations for type-use annotations {#recognized-type-use}

A location is a *recognized* location for our type-use annotations in the
circumstances detailed below. If our type-use annotations appear in any other
location, they have no meaning.

> When analyzing source code, tools are encouraged to offer an option to issue
> an error for an annotation in an unrecognized location. When reading
> *bytecode*, however, tools may be best off ignoring an annotation in an
> unrecognized location.

The following locations are recognized except when overruled by one of the
exceptions in the subsequent sections:

-   the return type of a method

-   a formal parameter type of a method or constructor, as defined in
    [JLS 8.4.1]

    > This excludes the receiver parameter but includes variadic parameters (in
    > varargs methods). For examples of variadic parameters, see the comment
    > about array components below.

-   a field type

-   a record component type

-   a type parameter upper bound

-   a non-wildcard type argument

-   a wildcard bound

-   an array component type

    > For an array of nullable strings, write `@Nullable String[]`. Similarly,
    > for a variadic parameter whose type is "array of nullable strings," write
    > `@Nullable String...`. Annotations are also recognized in
    > higher-dimensional arrays, such as in `String[] @Nullable []`.
    >
    > You can annotate array component types independently from the array
    > itself. For the array itself, you can annotate in the same cases as for
    > any non-array type in the same position, albeit with different syntax. For
    > example, you can annotate a method parameter as `@NonNull String @Nullable
    > [] strings`, which means `strings` is a nullable array containing non-null
    > elements. Similarly for variadic parameters, `void method(@Nullable String
    > @NonNull ... strings)` means `strings` is a non-null array containing
    > nullable elements.

However, the type-use annotation is unrecognized in any of the following cases:

-   a type usage of a primitive type, since those are intrinsically non-nullable

-   any component of a return type in an annotation interface, since those are
    intrinsically non-nullable

-   type arguments of a receiver parameter's type

    > Note that the receiver parameter root type is also unrecognized.

-   the type of the field corresponding to an enum constant

    > In source code, there is nowhere in the Java grammar for the type of an
    > enum constant to be written. Still, enum constants have a type, which is
    > made explicitly visible in the compiled class file.

-   any component of the type after the `instanceof`
    [type comparison operator][JLS 15.20.2]

    > We are likely to revisit this rule in the future.

-   any component in a [pattern]

    > We are likely to revisit this rule in the future.

All locations that are not explicitly listed as recognized are unrecognized.

## The declaration annotations

We provide two parameterless declaration annotations: `@NullMarked` and
`@NullUnmarked`.

### Recognized locations for declaration annotations {#recognized-declaration}

Our declaration annotations are specified to be *recognized* when applied to the
locations listed below:

-   A *named* class declaration.
-   A package declaration.
-   A module (for `@NullMarked` only, not `@NullUnmarked`) declaration.
-   A method or constructor declaration.

All locations that are not explicitly listed as recognized are unrecognized.

> That is, they are *not* recognized on a field, a parameter, a local variable,
> a type parameter, or a record component declaration.
>
> An anonymous class declaration cannot be annotated with a declaration
> annotation.

## Null-marked scope

To determine whether a type usage appears in a null-marked scope:

Iterate over all the declarations that enclose the type usage, starting from the
innermost.

"Enclosing" is defined as follows:

-   Each class member is enclosed by a class.
-   Each non-top-level class is enclosed by a class or class member.
-   Each top-level class is enclosed by a package.
-   Each package may be enclosed by a module.
-   Modules are not enclosed by anything.

> Packages are *not* enclosed by "parent" packages.
>
> This definition of "enclosing" largely matches
> [the definition in the Java compiler API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs/api/java.compiler/javax/lang/model/element/Element.html#getEnclosingElement\(\)).
> The JSpecify definition differs slightly by skipping type-parameter
> declarations (which cannot be annotated with our declaration annotations) and
> by defining that there exists a series of enclosing declarations for any type
> usage, not just for a declaration.

At each declaration that is a [recognized](#recognized-declaration) location,
check the following rules in order:

-   If the declaration is annotated with `@NullMarked` and *not* with
    `@NullUnmarked`, the type usage is in a null-marked scope.
-   If the declaration is annotated with `@NullUnmarked` and *not* with
    `@NullMarked`, the type usage is *not* in a null-marked scope.
-   If the declaration is a top-level class annotated with `@kotlin.Metadata`,
    then the type usage is *not* in a null-marked scope.

> Two of the rules here are worth further discussion.
>
> First: If a given declaration is annotated with both `@NullMarked` and
> `@NullUnmarked`, these rules behave as if neither annotation is present.
>
> Second: The rule for `@kotlin.Metadata` is a pragmatic compromise. The Kotlin
> compiler emits nullness annotations (currently, non-JSpecify annotations) on
> root types for method parameters, method returns, and fields, but it does not
> emit annotations elsewhere. In
> [some cases](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-13228), Kotlin allows
> authors to add nullness annotations in those locations manually. However, in
> general, Kotlin code is "missing" annotations, so it should not be treated as
> null-marked. As a pragmatic way to accommodate that, the spec has this rule to
> treat Kotlin code as null-unmarked, even when the code is located in a
> null-marked package or module.
>
> In the future, Kotlin may
> [emit full nullness information](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-47417),
> including a `@NullMarked` annotation at the class level. The spec rule for
> `@kotlin.Metadata` is formulated so that such code will automatically be
> treated as null-marked at that point. Additionally, it is formulated so that
> Kotlin code can be explicitly annotated as `@NullMarked` to override the
> `@kotlin.Metadata` rule for a class and any nested classes. (Another
> possibility even today is for tools to read the full Kotlin nullness
> information from `@kotlin.Metadata`.)

If none of the enclosing declarations meet any rule, then the type usage is
*not* in a null-marked scope.

## Augmented type of a type usage appearing in code {#augmented-type-of-usage}

This section defines how to determine the [augmented types] of most type usages
in source code or bytecode where JSpecify nullness annotations are
[recognized](#recognized-type-use).

> The rules here should be sufficient for most tools that care about nullness
> information, from build-time nullness checkers to runtime dependency-injection
> tools. However, tools that wish to examine class files in greater detail, such
> as to insert runtime null checks by rewriting bytecode, may encounter some
> edge cases. For example, `synthetic` methods may not have accurate annotations
> in their signatures. The same goes for information about implementation code,
> such as local-variable types.

Because the JLS already has rules for determining the [base type] for a type
usage, this section covers only how to determine its [nullness operator].

To determine the nullness operator *in a recognized location*, apply the
following rules in order. Once one condition is met, skip the remaining
conditions.

> If the type usage is in an intrinsically non-null location listed earlier, its
> nullness operator is `MINUS_NULL`. For other unrecognized locations, no
> nullness operator is applicable.
>
> For example, if the type usage is the type of the field corresponding to an
> enum constant, its nullness operator is `MINUS_NULL`. As another example, if
> the type usage is a component of a return type in an annotation interface, its
> nullness operator is `MINUS_NULL`.

-   If the type usage is annotated with `@Nullable` and *not* with `@NonNull`,
    its nullness operator is `UNION_NULL`.

-   If the type usage is annotated with `@NonNull` and *not* with `@Nullable`,
    its nullness operator is `MINUS_NULL`.

    > If the type usage is annotated with both `@Nullable` and `@NonNull`, these
    > rules behave as if neither annotation is present.

-   If the type usage is the parameter of `equals(Object)` in a subclass of
    `java.lang.Record`, then its nullness operator is `UNION_NULL`.

    > This special case handles the fact that the Java compiler automatically
    > generates an implementation of `equals` in `Record` but does not include a
    > `@Nullable` annotation on its parameter, even when the class is
    > `@NullMarked`. It is (currently, see
    > [JDK-8251375](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8251375)) not possible
    > to distinguish automatically generated `equals(Object)` methods from
    > manually written ones in bytecode. See
    > [further discussion](#expected-annotations-on-record-classes-equals-methods)
    > below.
    >
    > Note that special handling is not necessary for the return type of `String
    > toString()`.

-   If the type usage appears in a [null-marked scope], its nullness operator is
    `NO_CHANGE`.

-   Its nullness operator is `UNSPECIFIED`.

> The choice of nullness operator is *not* affected by any nullness operator
> that appears in a corresponding location in a supertype. For example, if one
> type declares a method whose return type is annotated `@Nullable`, and if
> another type overrides that method but does not declare the return type as
> `@Nullable`, then the override's return type will *not* have nullness operator
> `UNION_NULL`.

> If tool authors prefer, they can safely produce `MINUS_NULL` in any case in
> which it is equivalent to `NO_CHANGE`. For example, there is no difference
> between `Foo NO_CHANGE` and `Foo MINUS_NULL` for any class type `Foo` (nor for
> any array type or the null type). The difference *is* significant for
> intersection types, type variables, and union types.

## Augmented type of an intersection type {#intersection-types}

> Technically speaking, the JLS does not define syntax for an intersection type.
> Instead, it defines a syntax for type parameters and casts that supports
> multiple types. Then the intersection type is derived from those. Intersection
> types can also arise from operations like [capture conversion]. See [JLS 4.9].
>
> One result of this is that it is never possible for a programmer to write an
> annotation "on an intersection type."

This spec assigns a [nullness operator] to each individual element of an
intersection type, following our normal rules for type usages. It also assigns a
nullness operator to the intersection type as a whole. The nullness operator of
the type as a whole is always `NO_CHANGE`.

> This lets us provide, for every [base type], a rule for computing its
> [augmented type]. But we require `NO_CHANGE` so as to avoid questions like
> whether "a `UNION_NULL` intersection type whose members are `Foo UNION_NULL`
> and `Bar UNION_NULL`" is a subtype of "a `NO_CHANGE` intersection type with
> those same members." Plus, it would be difficult for tools to output the
> nullness operator of an intersection type in a human-readable way.

> To avoid ever creating an intersection type with a nullness operator other
> than `NO_CHANGE`, we define special handling for intersection types under
> ["Applying a nullness operator to an augmented type."][applying operator]

## Bound of an "unbounded" wildcard {#unbounded-wildcard}

In source, an unbounded wildcard is written as `<?>`. This section does *not*
apply to `<? extends Object>`, even though that is often equivalent to `<?>`.

> See [JLS 4.5.1].

In bytecode, such a wildcard is represented as a wildcard type with an empty
list of upper bounds and an empty list of lower bounds. This section does *not*
apply to a wildcard with any bounds in either list, even a sole upper bound of
`Object`.

> For a wildcard with an explicit bound of `Object` (that is, `<? extends
> Object>`, perhaps with an annotation on `Object`), instead apply
> [the normal rules](#augmented-type-of-usage) for the explicit bound type.

If an unbounded wildcard appears in a [null-marked scope], then it has a single
upper bound whose [base type] is `Object` and whose [nullness operator] is
`UNION_NULL`.

If an unbounded wildcard appears outside a null-marked scope, then it has a
single upper bound whose base type is `Object` and whose nullness operator is
`UNSPECIFIED`.

> In both cases, we specify a bound that does not exist in the source or
> bytecode, deviating from the JLS. Because the base type of the bound is
> `Object`, this should produce no user-visible differences except to tools that
> implement JSpecify nullness analysis.

Whenever a JLS rule refers specifically to `<?>`, disregard it, and instead
apply the rules for `<? extends T>`, where `T` has a base type of `Object` and
the nullness operator defined by this section.

## Bound of an `Object`-bounded type parameter {#object-bounded-type-parameter}

In source, an `Object`-bounded type parameter can be writen in either of two
ways:

-   `<T>`
-   `<T extends Object>` with no JSpecify nullness type annotations on the bound

> See [JLS 4.4].

In bytecode, `<T>` and `<T extends Object>` are both represented as a type
parameter with a single upper bound, `Object`, and no JSpecify nullness type
annotations on the bound.

If an `Object`-bounded type parameter appears in a [null-marked scope], then its
bound has a [base type] of `Object` and a [nullness operator] of `NO_CHANGE`.

> Note that this gives `<T>` a different bound than `<?>` (though only in a
> null-marked scope).

If an `Object`-bounded type parameter appears outside a null-marked scope, then
its bound has a base type of `Object` and a nullness operator of `UNSPECIFIED`.

> All these rules match the behavior of
> [our normal rules](#augmented-type-of-usage) for determining the
> [augmented type] of the bound `Object`. The only "special" part is that we
> consider the source code `<T>` to have a bound of `Object`, just as it does
> when compiled to bytecode.

## Augmented null types {#null-types}

The JLS refers to "the null type." In this spec, we assign a [nullness operator]
to all types, including the null type. This produces multiple null types:

-   the null [base type] with nullness operator `NO_CHANGE`: the
    "bottom"/"nothing" type used in [capture conversion]

    > No value has this type, not even `null` itself.

-   the null base type with nullness operator `MINUS_NULL`

    > This is equivalent to the previous type. Tools may use the two
    > interchangeably.

-   the null base type with nullness operator `UNION_NULL`: the type of the null
    reference

-   the null base type with nullness operator `UNSPECIFIED`

    > This may be relevant only in implementation code.

## Multiple "worlds" {#multiple-worlds}

Some of the rules in this spec come in two versions: One version requires a
property to hold "in all worlds," and the other requires it to hold only "in
some world."

Tool authors may choose to implement neither, either, or both versions of the
rules.

> Our goal is to allow tools and their users to choose their desired level of
> strictness in the presence of `UNSPECIFIED`. The basic idea is that, every
> time a tool encounters a type component with the nullness operator
> `UNSPECIFIED`, it has the option to fork off three "worlds": one in which the
> operator is `UNION_NULL`, one in which it is `MINUS_NULL`, and one in which it
> is `NO_CHANGE`.
>
> In more detail: When tools lack a nullness specification for a type, they may
> choose to assume that any of the resulting worlds may be the "correct"
> specification. The all-worlds version of a rule, by requiring types to be
> compatible in all possible worlds, holds that types are incompatible unless it
> has enough information to prove they are compatible. The some-world version,
> by requiring types to be compatible only in *some* world, holds that types are
> compatible unless it has enough information to prove they are incompatible.
> (By behaving "optimistically," the some-world version is much like Kotlin's
> rules for "platform types.")
>
> Thus, a strict tool might choose to implement the all-worlds version of rules,
> and a lenient tool might choose to implement the some-world version. Yet
> another tool might implement both and let users select which rules to apply.
>
> Still another possibility is for a tool to implement both versions and to use
> that to distinguish between "errors" and "warnings." Such a tool might always

### Propagating how many worlds a relation must hold in {#propagating-multiple-worlds}

When one rule in this spec refers to another, it refers to the same version of
the rule. For example, when the rules for [containment] refer to the rules for
[subtyping], the some-world containment relation refers to the some-world
subtyping relation, and the all-worlds containment relation refers to the
all-worlds subtyping relation.

This meta-rule applies except when a rule refers explicitly to a particular
version of another rule.

## Comfortable with a given nullness operator {#comfortable}

There is *reason to be comfortable treating a given [nullness operator] `g` like

## Same type

`S` and `T` are the same type if `S` is a [subtype] of `T` and `T` is a subtype
of `S`.

The same-type relation is *not* defined to be reflexive or transitive.

## Subtyping

`A` is a subtype of `F` if all of the following conditions are met:

-   The base type of `A` is a subtype of the base type of `F` according to
    Java's subtyping rules.

    > This condition is rarely of direct interest to tools' JSpecify support: If
    > code does not pass Java's subtyping rules, then most JSpecify tools will
    > never see it.

-   `A` is a [nullness subtype] of `F`.

    > This condition suffices to establish subtyping for most cases.

-   `A` is a subtype of `F` according to the
    [nullness-delegating subtyping rules for Java].

    > This condition is necessary only for types that have subcomponentsâ€”namely,
    > parameterized types and arrays. And it essentially says "Check the
    > nullness-subtype condition on subcomponents as appropriate."

## Nullness subtyping

`A` is a nullness subtype of `F` if any of the following conditions are met:

> Nullness subtyping asks the question: If `A` includes `null`, does `F` also
> include `null`? There are four cases in which this is true, two easy and two

-   `F` is [null-inclusive under every parameterization].

    > This is the first easy case: `F` always includes `null`.

-   `A` is [null-exclusive under every parameterization].

    > This is the second easy case: `A` never includes `null`.

-   `A` has a [nullness-subtype-establishing path] to any type whose base type
    is the same as the base type of `F`, and there is *not* reason to be
    [worried] that `F` has [nullness operator] `MINUS_NULL`.

    > This is the first hard case: A given type-variable usage does not
    > necessarily always include `null`, nor does it necessarily always exclude
    > `null`. (For example, consider a usage of `E` inside `ArrayList<E>`.

-   `F` is a type-variable usage that meets *both* of the following conditions:

    -   There is *not* reason to be worried that it has nullness operator
        `MINUS_NULL`.

    -   `A` is a nullness subtype of its lower bound.

Contrast this with our [nullness-delegating subtyping] rules and [containment]
rules: Each of those is defined as a transitive closure. However, this is
incorrect, and we should fix it: Transitivity causes the same problem there as
it does here: `List<? extends @Nullable String>` ends up as a subtype of `List<?
extends String>` because of a chain of subtyping rules that uses `String
UNSPECIFIED` as part of the intermediate step. Luckily, tool authors that set
out to implement transitivity for these two rules are very unlikely to write
code that "notices" this chain. So, in practice, users are likely to see the
"mostly transitive" behavior that we intend, even if we have not found a way to
formally specify it yet.

## Null-inclusive under every parameterization

A type is null-inclusive under every parameterization if it meets any of the
following conditions:

-   There is reason to be [comfortable] treating its [nullness operator] like
    `UNION_NULL`.

-   It is an [intersection type] whose elements all are null-inclusive under
    every parameterization.

-   It is a type variable that meets *both* of the following conditions:

    -   There is *not* reason to be [worried] that it has nullness operator
        `MINUS_NULL`.

    -   Its lower bound is null-inclusive under every parameterization.

    > This third case is probably irrelevant in practice: It covers `? super
    > @Nullable Foo`, which is already covered by the rules for
    > [nullness subtyping]. It is included here in case some tool has reason to
    > check whether a type is null-inclusive under every parameterization
    > *outside* of a check for nullness subtyping.

## Null-exclusive under every parameterization

> This is a straightforward concept ("never includes `null`"), but it is not as

> rule has to cover cases like `String`, `E` (where `<E extends Object>`), and

> why the following rule requires looking for a "path."

A type is null-exclusive under every parameterization if it has a
[nullness-subtype-establishing path] to either of the following:

-   any type whose [nullness operator] there is reason to be [comfortable]
    treating as `MINUS_NULL`

    > This covers an easy case: A type usage never includes `null` if it is
    > annotated with `@NonNull`.

-   any augmented class, array, or null type

    > This rule refers to particular kinds of types as distinct from other types
    > like type variables and [intersection types].

> When code dereferences an expression, we anticipate that tools will check
> whether the expression is null-exclusive under every parameterization.

## Nullness-subtype-establishing path

> Note that this definition is used both by the definition of
> [null-exclusive under every parameterization] and by the third condition in
> the definition [nullness subtyping] itself (the "type-variable case").

`A` has a nullness-subtype-establishing path to `F` if both of the following
hold:

-   There is *not* reason to be [worried] that the nullness operator of `A` is
    `UNION_NULL`.
-   There is a path from `A` to `F` through
    [nullness-subtype-establishing direct-supertype edges].

    > The path may be empty. That is, `A` has a nullness-subtype-establishing
    > path to itselfâ€”as long as it has one of the required nullness operators.

## Nullness-subtype-establishing direct-supertype edges

`T` has nullness-subtype-establishing direct-supertype edges to all the
following types, subject to the exception given below:

-   if `T` is an augmented [intersection type]: all the intersection type's
    elements

-   if `T` is an augmented type variable: all the corresponding type parameter's
    upper bounds

-   otherwise: no nodes

Exception: `T` does *not* have edges to any types whose [nullness operator]
there is reason to be [worried] is `UNION_NULL`.

## Nullness-delegating subtyping rules for Java {#nullness-delegating-subtyping}

> Recall that this rule exists to handle subcomponents of typesâ€”namely, type
> arguments and array component types. It essentially says "Check nullness
> subtyping for subcomponents as appropriate."

The Java subtyping rules are defined in [JLS 4.10]. (Each rule takes a type as
input and produces zero or more direct supertypes as outputs.) We add to them as
follows:

-   [As always](#concept-references), interpret the Java rules as operating on
    [augmented types], not [base types]. This raises the question of *how* to
    extend these particular rules to operate on augmented types. The answer has
    two parts:

    -   The first part of the answer applies only to the nullness operator *"of
        the type."* ([As always](#augmented-type), this means the nullness
        operator of the type component that is the entire type.)

        And the first part of the answer is: No matter what nullness operator
        the input augmented type has, the rules still apply, and they still
        produce the same direct supertypes.

        > Thanks to that rule, the nullness operator of any *output* type is
        > never read by the subtyping rules.

        So, when computing output types, tools may produce them with *any*
        nullness operator.

        > Essentially, this rule says that the top-level types do not matter:
        > They have already been checked by the [nullness subtyping] check.
        >
        > For simplicity, we recommend producing a nullness operator of
        > `NO_CHANGE`: That operator is valid for all types, including
        > [intersection types].

    -   The nullness operators of *subcomponents* of the augmented types *do*
        matter. For example, some Java rules produce subtypes only if
        subcomponents meet certain requirements.
        [As always](#concept-references), check those requirements by applying
        *this spec's* definitions.

        > Those definitions (like [containment]) refer back to definitions (like
        > [nullness subtyping]) that use the nullness operators of the
        > subcomponents in question.

-   When the Java array rules require one type to be a *direct* supertype of
    another, consider the direct supertypes of `T` to be *every* type that `T`
    is a [subtype] of.

## Containment

The Java rules are defined in [JLS 4.5.1]. We add to them as follows:

-   Disregard the two rules that refer to a bare `?`. Instead, treat `?` like `?
    extends Object`, where the [nullness operator] of the `Object` bound is
    specified by ["Bound of an unbounded wildcard."](#unbounded-wildcard)

    > This is just a part of our universal rule to treat a bare `?` like `?
    > extends Object`.

-   The rule written specifically for `? extends Object` applies only if there
    is reason to be [comfortable] treating the nullness operator of the `Object`
    bound as `UNION_NULL`.

-   When the JLS refers to the same type `T` on both sides of a rule, the rule
    applies if and only if this spec defines the two types to be the
    [same type].

## Substitution

> Substitution on Java base types barely requires an explanation: See [JLS 1.3].
> Substitution on [augmented types], however, is trickier: If `Map.get` returns
> `V UNION_NULL`, and if a user has a map whose value type is `String
> UNSPECIFIED`, then what does its `get` method return? Naive substitution would
> produce `String UNSPECIFIED UNION_NULL`. To reduce that to a proper augmented
> type with a single nullness operator, we define this process.

To substitute each type argument `Aáµ¢` for each corresponding type parameter
`Páµ¢`:

For every type-variable usage `V` whose [base type] is `Páµ¢`, replace `V` with
the output of the following operation:

-   If `V` is [null-exclusive under every parameterization] in [all worlds],
    then replace it with the output of [applying][applying operator]
    `MINUS_NULL` to `Aáµ¢`.

    > The purpose of this part of the subsitution rule is to ensure that
    > non-null type variables stay non-null during substitution, even if they
    > don't have an explicit `@NonNull` annotation on them.
    >
    > For an example of such a type, consider `Comparable`, a `@NullMarked`
    > interface that declares a non-nullable type parameter `T` and a method
    > `compare(T)`. By JSpecify rules, the method parameter has type `T
    > NO_CHANGE`, and that type is null-exclusive under every parameterization
    > in all worlds. Now consider a null-unmarked class that declares a method
    > `Comparable<Foo> foo()`, which by JSpecify rules has a type argument `Foo
    > UNSPECIFIED`. In this example, the question is what type
    > `foo().compare(...)` accepts. That question demonstrates the effect of
    > this part of the subsitution rule:
    >
    > -   Without this part of the rule, JSpecify would directly subsitute `Foo
    >     UNSPECIFIED` for `T`. Then the parameter type, which started out as
    >     non-null, would become unspecified as a result of the subsitution. As
    >     a result, lenient checkers would allow the call `foo().compare(null)`,
    >     since `Foo UNSPECIFIED` is
    >     [null-inclusive under every parameterization] in [some world].
    > -   To avoid that, JSpecify uses this rule to recognize that the parameter
    >     is non-null, and it performs substitution as if the parameter type
    >     were `T MINUS_NULL` instead of `T NO_CHANGE`. As a result, the
    >     parameter type remains non-null after substitution (`String
    >     MINUS_NULL`), and even lenient checkers can produce an error for the
    >     call `foo().compare(null)`.
    >
    > Also, note that this is the one instance in which a rule specifically
    > refers to the [all-worlds] version of another rule. Normally,
    > [a rule "propagates" its version to other rules](#propagating-multiple-worlds).
    > But in this instance, the null-exclusivity rule (and all rules that it in
    > turn applies) are the [all-worlds] versions.

-   Otherwise, replace `V` with the output of applying the nullness operator of
    `V` to `Aáµ¢`.

## Applying a nullness operator to an augmented type {#applying-operator}

The process of applying a [nullness operator] requires two inputs:

-   the nullness operator to apply
-   the [augmented type] \(which, as always, includes a nullness operator for
    that type) to apply it to

The output of the process is an augmented type.

To determine the output, apply the following rules in order.

-   If the nullness operator to apply is `NO_CHANGE`, then the output augmented
    type is the input augmented type.

-   Otherwise, if the input augmented type is an [intersection type], then the
    output is also an intersection type. For every element `Táµ¢` of the input
    type, the output type has an element that is the output of applying the
    desired nullness operator to `Táµ¢`.

-   Otherwise, the output is a type that is the same as the input augmented type
    except with its nullness operator set to the nullness operator to apply.

## Capture conversion

The Java rules are defined in [JLS 5.1.10]. We add to them as follows:

-   The parameterized type that is the output of the conversion has the same
    [nullness operator] as the parameterized type that is the input type.

-   Disregard the JLS rule about `<?>`. Instead, treat `?` like `? extends
    Object`, where the [nullness operator] of the `Object` bound is specified by
    ["Bound of an unbounded wildcard."](#unbounded-wildcard)

    > This is just a part of our universal rule to treat a bare `?` like `?
    > extends Object`.

-   Whenever the rules generate a usage of a fresh type variable, that usage has
    nullness operator `NO_CHANGE`.

-   When a rule generates a lower bound that is the null type, we specify that
    its nullness operator is `NO_CHANGE`.

    > See ["Augmented null types."](#null-types)

## Expected annotations on record classes' `equals` methods

> Because of the special case [above](#augmented-type-of-usage) that makes
> parameters of record classes' `equals` methods always nullable, we include
> this rule so that tools can produce expected errors in some cases when the
> parameter is not annotated with `@Nullable`.

If a type usage is the parameter of `equals(Object)` in a subclass of
`java.lang.Record`, then:

-   It is not expected to be annotated with `@NonNull`.
-   If it appears in null-marked code, or if this rule is required to hold in
    [all worlds], then it is expected to be annotated with `@Nullable`.
