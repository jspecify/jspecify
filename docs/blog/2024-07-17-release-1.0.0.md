We are pleased to announce that
[JSpecify 1.0.0](https://github.com/jspecify/jspecify/releases/tag/v1.0.0) is
available in
[Maven Central](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/jspecify/jspecify/1.0.0/)!
That means that the four nullness annotations that we have defined
([`@Nullable`](https://jspecify.dev/docs/api/org/jspecify/annotations/Nullable.html),
[`@NonNull`](https://jspecify.dev/docs/api/org/jspecify/annotations/NonNull.html),
[`@NullMarked`](https://jspecify.dev/docs/api/org/jspecify/annotations/NullMarked.html),
and
[`@NullUnmarked`](https://jspecify.dev/docs/api/org/jspecify/annotations/NullUnmarked.html))
are official, and we will never make backwards-incompatible changes to them.

Check out our [usage page](/docs/using) for instructions on how to depend on
them in your project, and our guidelines on
[when you should start](/docs/whether) doing so. (Hint: it depends on how ready
your nullness analyzer is to support JSpecify, and whether you or your users
also use Kotlin.)

We've updated our [User Guide](/docs/user-guide) and our
[Javadoc](https://jspecify.dev/docs/api/). ~We're still working on updating the
[specification](/docs/spec) to reflect all of our design decisions (ETA: end of
August), but that's more useful to nullness analyzer implementers.~

October update: We've now also updated our [specification](/docs/spec).
