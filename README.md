# JSpecify

An artifact of well-specified annotations to power static analysis checks and
JVM language interop. Developed by consensus of the partner organizations listed
at our main web site, [jspecify.org](https://jspecify.dev).

Our current focus is on annotations for nullness analysis.

## Status

We've released
[Version 1.0.0](https://github.com/jspecify/jspecify/releases/tag/v1.0.0), which
finalizes our initial nullness annotations.
