# JSpecify

An artifact of well-specified annotations to power static analysis checks and JVM language interoperability.
Developed by consensus of the partner organizations listed at our main web site, jspecify.org.

Our current focus is on annotations for nullness analysis.

The latest release is numbered 0.2 as a clear signal to **not** depend on it yet.
It will still undergo many changes.
