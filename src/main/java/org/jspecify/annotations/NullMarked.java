/**
 * Indicates that the annotated element and the code transitively {@linkplain
 * javax.lang.model.element.Element#getEnclosedElements() enclosed} within it are <b>null-marked
 * code</b>: there, type usages are generally considered to exclude {@code null} as a value unless
 * specified otherwise. Using this annotation avoids the need to write {@link NonNull @NonNull} many
 * times throughout your code.
 *
 * <p>The effects of this annotation can be negated at a narrower scope using {@link NullUnmarked}.
 *
 * <p>For a comprehensive introduction to JSpecify, please see <a
 * href="https://jspecify.dev">jspecify.org</a>.
 *
 * <h2 id="effects">Effects of being null-marked</h2>
 *
 * <p>Within null-marked code, a type usage is generally considered to be non-null unless explicitly
 * annotated as {@link Nullable}. However, there are a few special cases to address.
 *
 * <h3 id="effects-special-cases">Special cases</h3>
 *
 * <p>Within null-marked code:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Any type usage where {@code @Nullable} and {@code @NonNull} are <a
 *       href="Nullable.html#applicability"><b>not applicable</b></a>, such as the root type of a
 *       local variable declaration, is unaffected.
 *   <li>A <b>wildcard</b> with no upper bound generally represents a nullable type (unless the
 *       corresponding type parameter has a non-null upper bound itself). (<a
 *       href="https://bit.ly/3ppb8ZC">Why?</a>) This might be either an unbounded wildcard, as in
 *       {@code List<?>}, or a wildcard with a lower bound, as in {@code List<? super Integer>}). 
 *   <li>A <b>type parameter</b> itself is a different case. It is never really "unbounded"; if no
 *       upper bound is given explicitly, then {@code Object} is filled in by the compiler. This
 *       means the example {@code class MyList<E>} is interpreted identically to {@code class
 *       MyList<E extends Object>}, making the upper bound <em>non-null</em> {@code Object}. (<a
 *       href="https://bit.ly/3ppb8ZC">Why?</a>)
 *   <li>When a type parameter has a nullable upper bound, such as the {@code E} in {@code class
 *       Foo<E extends @Nullable Bar>}), an unannotated usage of this type variable itself (within
 *       that class) has a special kind of nullness called <b>parametric nullness</b>. In order to
 *       support both nullable and non-null type arguments safely, the {@code E} type itself must be
 *       handled pessimistically: treated as if nullable when read from, but as if non-null when
 *       written to.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2 id="where">Where it can be used</h2>
 *
 * {@code @NullMarked} and {@link NullUnmarked @NullUnmarked} can be used on any package, class,
 * method, or constructor declaration; {@code @NullMarked} can be used on a module declaration as
 * well. Special considerations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>To apply these annotations to an entire (single) <b>package</b>, create a <a
 *       href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se23/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.4.1">{@code
 *       package-info.java}</a> file and annotate the package declaration there. This annotation has
 *       no effect on "subpackages". <b>Warning</b>: if the package does not belong to a module, be
 *       very careful: it can easily happen that different versions of the package-info file are
 *       seen and used in different circumstances, causing the same classes to be interpreted
 *       inconsistently.
 *   <li>An advantage of Java <b>modules</b> is that you can make a lot of code null-marked with
 *       just a single annotation (before the {@code module} keyword). {@link NullUnmarked} is not
 *       supported on modules, since it's already the default behavior.
 *   <li>Applying this annotation to an annotation interface has the same meaning as any other class
 *       declaration: that declaration and its members are in null-marked context. It does
 *       <i>not</i> express that annotations of that type are synonymous with {@code @NullMarked}.
 *   <li>These annotations have no meaning when applied to a <b>record component</b> declaration (as
 *       in {@code record Foo(@NullMarked String bar) {}}). ({@link Nullable} and {@link NonNull} are
 *       still meaningful for record components.)
 *   <li>If both {@code @NullMarked} and {@code @NullUnmarked} appear together on the same element,
 *       <i>neither</i> one is recognized.
 * </ul>
